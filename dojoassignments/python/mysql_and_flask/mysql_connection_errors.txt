'database': dba, # we got db as an argument
NameError: global name 'dba' is not defined
Fix by making sure ‘database’: db <- is the variable you define as the parameter.

2. 
OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'robot'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")
User name was ‘robot’ instead of ‘root’. Fixed upon changing back to root.

OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)")
Password was ‘boot’ instead of ‘root’, same error as when username is incorrect!

4. OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (61)")

Error comes from setting port to 123 instead of 8889. Fixed upon setting the port back.
